# 🛳 Titanic Survival Analysis – Exploratory Data Visualization

This project is an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of the famous Titanic dataset using Python libraries such as **Pandas**, **Seaborn**, and **Matplotlib**.  
The goal is to uncover patterns and insights that influenced passenger survival — such as class, age, gender, and fare.

> 🧠 _Note: This project focuses only on data visualization and insight generation. I’ll be building and training predictive models on this dataset in the upcoming phase._

## 📌 Project Highlights

- 🧮 Cleaned and structured the Titanic dataset
- 📊 Visualized demographic distributions (age, gender, class)
- ⚰️ Analyzed survival patterns by class, gender, and age
- 💸 Explored financial aspects such as fare distribution
- 🔍 Studied feature relationships using heatmaps and correlation matrices

## 🚧 What's Next?

- 💡 I'll be training **Machine Learning models** on this dataset soon to predict survival.
- Will explore **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and more using **scikit-learn**.
